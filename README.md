# Password-Encoder-Vulnerability-Checker
Python script that encodes your password of choice into SHA1 format, hashes it, and shortens the hash to find instances of your password on the haveibeenpwned password api. 
Inspired by "Have You Been Pwned? - Computerphile" youtube video and the haveibeenpwned web application and password api. The script accepts a text input of a password, encodes it to SHA1 format and converts it to hexadecimal. It then takes the first 5 characters of the hex and sends it to the api through a get request. The information that returns includes how many instances of the password or variations of the password exists in a public database, adds it all up, and sends it back to the user.
